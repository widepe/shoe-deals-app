    <h3>1. What Shoe Beagle Does</h3>
    <p>Shoe Beagle helps you discover and compare prices on running shoes from third-party retailers. We do not sell products directly, process payments, or fulfill orders. When you click a link to a retailer, you leave Shoe Beagle and complete any purchase on the retailer’s website.</p>
    <p>Some links may be affiliate links, which means Shoe Beagle may earn a small commission if you make a purchase, at no extra cost to you.</p>

    <h3>2. No Guarantees on Prices or Availability</h3>
    <p>We work to display accurate and timely deal information, but prices, discounts, and availability can change quickly. We cannot guarantee that any price or offer listed on Shoe Beagle will still be available or accurate when you visit a retailer’s site.</p>

    <h3>3. Your Responsibilities</h3>

      <li>Provide accurate contact information if you choose to set alerts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Price Alerts</h3>
    <p>If you set a price alert, you agree to receive alert-related messages using the contact details you provide. You can manage or cancel your alerts at any time. We do not guarantee that every qualifying deal will trigger an alert or reach you.</p>
